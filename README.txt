CHANGES
version 2018051402:

The first iteration of the plugin. Requires Moodle 3.5

ABOUT

In the latest versions of moodle the switch role feature/link has been moved in the user menu of the theme.
In case you still want it in the blocks area or your theme doesn't have implemented the user menu or you have moodle embedded inside another application this block may help.
Block redirects to the standard switch role page.


SETTINGS

This block plugin allows you to configure: nothing for the moment.


INSTALLATION

Just place the switchrole directory inside your Moodle's blocks directory.
Install the plugin.
The block can be added at course level or site level.
